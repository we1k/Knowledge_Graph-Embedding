A collection of Knowledge Graphe Embedding method. 
included a new weighted negative sampling stradegy, weighted random walk stradegy according to neighbor's score function.
Intuition: a hard (also high-quality) negative sample is more likely to have high score during gradient descent.
Pick them as negative samples may intuitively alleviate gradient vanishing
